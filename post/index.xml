      <description>Ex ante forecast is a forecast based solely on information available at the time of the forecast, whereas ex post forecast is a forecast that uses information beyond the time at which the forecast is made. Let’s discuss the two in more detail, as in different contexts the terms may mean slightly different things.
Introduction Only one thing is true about forecasts - they are always wrong. Any forecast $\widehat{Y_t}$ of the actual value $Y_t$ is associated with the forecast error $e_t=Y_t−\widehat{Y_t}$.</description>

      <description>This quick post is largely for testing purposes. It aims at sharing four motivational quotes that I carefully selected for the introductory page of the front matter of my PhD thesis. It was entitled Statistical issues in modelling and forecasting sequential count data and examined by professors James Taylor of Oxford University and Williams Dunsmuir of the University of New South Wales at the end of 2012. I will revisit some of the more interesting points developed there in this blog but for now, here are the promised quotes in the original order.</description>
